      <div>
        This is an underestimate, as the data is poorly collected by the Water Companies, with monitoring defective or
        in
        many cases completely absent. Many recordings of data don't seem to be associated with a valid permit, so it is
        impossible to know where they are.

      <div>
        This pollution affects the whole country. Here are the top 10 constituencies by hours of spill events, that
        we've managed to match.

      <h3>Into all water courses</h3>

      <div>Sewage overflows happen into all types of water system. Freshwater suddenly doesn't sound so fresh.</div>

      <div className="center">
        <SpillsByWaterType/>
      </div>

      <h3>Into all rivers</h3>

      <div>Some rivers seem to receive more sewage than others</div>

      <div className="center">
        <SpillsByRiver/>
      </div>

      <h3>Seasides</h3>

      <div>We would like clean beaches - but sewage spills are happening all the time at beach locations.</div>

      <div className="center">
        <BathingSewage/>
      </div>

      <h3>Shellfisheries</h3>

      <div>Shellfish can become unfit for human consumption when polluted by sewage.</div>

      <div className="center">
        <ShellfishSewage/>
      </div>

      <h3>Data Quality</h3>

      <div>
        Data quality appears very poor. In our naive understanding, each spill event record should be matched with a
        'consent' - however
        some companies don't seem to match up very well at all. In this graph the "matched" values are overstated due to
        multiple 'consent'
        records existing with the same id.
      </div>

      <div>
        To put this another way - if the spill records list 'consents' that don't appear in the consent database, do
        these consents
        exist at all. Even more obviously, Severn Trent Water lists 1199 spill events as 'No Known Permit', and
        Northumbrian Water lists
        519 as 'Permit Anomaly'
      </div>

      <div className="center">
        <DataMatch/>
      </div>

      <h3>Incomplete Monitoring</h3>

      <div>
        Monitoring is incomplete for many events. These graphs show how complete the monitoring is for the various spill
        events, as a percentage of time that the spill was happening. Notice how quite a few events
        have <i>zero</i> percent
        monitoring. They were completely unmonitored, for various reasons.
