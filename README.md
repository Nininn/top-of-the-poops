# Top Of The Poops

Website: [top-of-the-poops.org](https://top-of-the-poops.org)

Seems that [#sewage](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sewage) is on people's minds right now.

The UK publishes some information about sewage outfalls - here are some scripts to get this information, analyse it, and
perhaps publish some interesting findings.

## How to use

You can clone the repo - I use IntelliJ IDEA to make a hot-reloading web page. 
The javascript build runs with `make watch` - then make sure to `make prod` before pushing to prod.

`make watch` uses inotify - this may not work on MacOS.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome - especially CSS / Javascript improvements! But please chat before doing any real work - to make sure everyone is aligned with direction. 

### Development Environment

This has been developed on Linux, the makefiles may or may not work on a Mac.

### Setting up the database

```shell
make python
cd db/data
make load-all
```

### Generating json data files

You'll need to have set up the database stuff first

```shell
make generated
```
