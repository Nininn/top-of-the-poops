Investigations have highlighted the need to install additional monitors to differentiate between the impact of saline ingress causing tidal overflows and actual storm water overflows, i.e. where the EDM is recording the tide backing up the outfall and then discharging via the CSO. We are currently investigating the best method to discount tidally affected discharges and will report back to you with our methodology for agreement before removing tidal overflows from future submissions.

Investigations have highlighted the need to install additional monitors to differentiate between the impact of saline ingress causing tidal overflows and actual storm water overflows, i.e. where the EDM is recording the tide backing up the outfall and then discharging via the CSO. We are currently investigating the best method to discount tidally affected discharges and will report back to you with our methodology for agreement before removing tidal overflows from future submissions."
